# Bookstore Test

We want a webpage to sell books.

For each book we want to show the title, authors, cover image and price.

A book could have a base price and we could add a discount in a date range.

For example:

Book base price is $10 but from 1-1-2023 to 1-31-2023 the price is $7



1) Create a gallery to show the books
2) Create a CRUD for books
